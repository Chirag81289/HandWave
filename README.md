# HandWave
========

> An Android library that allows developers to add touch free capabilities to their mobile applications.

## Overview 
HandWave uses the built-in, forward-facing camera on a device and computer vision to recognize usersâ€™ in-air gestures. The API provides application developers with easy, high-level access to a variety of touch-free gestures that can be detected using any commodity smartphone equipped with a basic forward-facing camera. 

Example apps using the HandWave library can be found [here] (https://github.com/kritts/HandWave-Sample-Apps).

The code for the library is all available if you'd like to make changes. However, the .jar file is also available if not. Further details about how to use the library in your code are included below. 


A video demonstrating capabilities of the library can be found here:

## Using the HandWave library

To use this library, there are two libraries you need to put into your app's /lib folder: touchfreelibrary.jar and opencv library - 2.4.3.jar. 
It's up to you which version of OpenCV you'd like to use (all of the recent versions should work just fine), but the 2.4.3 is the version I used during development. 
A copy of the touchfreelibrary.jar can be found here:

The code for this library was initially created by Leeran Raphaely (leeran.raphaely@gmail.com). 
It has since been modified to fix bugs in the code and improve the overall speed of the algorithms.  
The changes were made by Krittika D'Silva (krittika.dsilva@gmail.com) and Nicola Dell (nixdell@cs.washington.edu).
