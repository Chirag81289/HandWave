HandWave
========

HandWave is an Android library that allows developers to add touch free capabilities to their mobile applications.


This code was initially created by Leeran Raphaely (leeran.raphaely@gmail.com), but has been modified and changed to reduce errors and improve speed.

This readme will be updated soon and demo mobile apps using HandWave will be added to this Github repo.

These apps were developed by Krittika D'Silva (kdsilva@uw.edu) and Nicola Dell (nixdell@cs.washington.edu).
